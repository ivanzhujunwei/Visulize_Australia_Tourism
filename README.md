# Visualization_Australia_Tourism
## Problem description and motivation

Australia is a destination for holiday, one of the top ratings when it comes to natural environment and “world class beauty”. It is reported, in 2016, visitors spent 39.1 billion travelling in Australia (The NewDaily, 2017). There are lots of visitors from all over the world coming to Australia every year, attracted by Australia’s beautiful landscape, excellent education system, etc. As one of these visitors, I want to explore more about the increasing visitors and proposed several questions as described below.
> - What are the countries that visitors are mainly coming from?
> - Which country has the largest number of tourists to Australia in different years?
> - How the trending regarding the expenditure spent when visitors pay a visit to Australia?
>  - What areas are visitors spending money on?
>  - Which state is the most popular?
